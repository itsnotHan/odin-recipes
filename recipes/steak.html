    <img src="../img/steak1.jpg" alt="delicious steak" width="500" height="600">

    <p> <h4> <strong> Description </strong> </h4> </p> 
    Super easy pan-seared steak that has a garlic rosemary-infused butter that
    makes it taste like a steakhouse quality meal. Seared and caramleized on the outside, and
    so juicy and tender on the inside.

    <p> <h4> <strong> Ingredients </strong> </h4> </p>
    <ui> 
        <li>2 lbs New York Steaks</li>
        <li>1/2 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper, freshly grounded</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and quartered</li>
        <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
    </ui>

    <p> <h4> <strong> Steps </strong> </h4> </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Throughly pat steak dry with paper towels. Just before cooking,
            generously season with 1 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp black pepper
        </li>
        <li>Heat the cast iron pan until hot then add 1/2 Tbsp oil over medium 
            heat swirling to coat.
        </li>
        <li>Once the oil is very hot, add steaks to skillet. </li>
        <li>Sear steaks on first side for 4 minutes until brown crust has formed,
            then flip and do the same. Use tongs to turn steak on its sides to render 
            the white fat and sear edges (1-min per edge).
        </li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium and add 2 Tbsp butter, garlic cloves, and
            romemary to pan. Spoon the butter sauce over steak, continue doing
            until the steak is about 5-10 degrees from desired doneness.
        </li>
        <li> Transfer steak to a cutting board, loosely cover and rest 10 min before
            slicing into 1/2" strips to serve.
        </li>
        <li>Finally, enjoy delicious steak!</li>
    </ol>
