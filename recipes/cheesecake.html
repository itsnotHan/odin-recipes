    <p> <h4> <strong> Description </strong> </h4> </p> 
    Delicious easy cheesecake recipe with just 4 simple ingredients that bakes in 30 mins.

    <p> <h4> <strong> Ingredients </strong> </h4> </p>
    <h5><strong>Crust</strong></h5>
    <ui>
        <li>1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li> 5 1/3 tablespoon butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ui>
    <h5><strong>Filling</strong></h5>
    <ui>
        <li>2 8-ounce cream cheese (room temperature)</li>
        <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    </ui>

    <p> <h4> <strong> Steps </strong> </h4> </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select a pie pan whose inside top dimension is at least 9", and whose 
            height is at least 1 1/4". Preheat the oven to 350Â°F</li>
        <li>To make the crust: Stir together all of the crust 
            ingredients, mixing until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Press the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides of the pie pan, 
            making a thicker layer on the bottom than on the sides.</li>
        <li>To make the filling: Mix together the room-temperature cream cheese 
            and sugar until smooth. Mix in the eggs and vanilla, again mixing until smooth. 
            To avoid beating too much air into the batter, use a mixer set at low-medium speed. 
            To avoid lumps, make sure the cream cheese is softened, and/or at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Set the pie pan onto a baking sheet, if desired; this makes it easier to transport 
            in and out of the oven, and also protects the bottom of the crust from any 
            potential scorching. Pour the filling into the crust.</li>
        <li>Place the cheesecake in the oven. Bake it for 20 minutes, then add a crust shield; 
            or shield the crust with strips of aluminum foil. Bake for an additional 10 minutes 
            (for a total of about 30 minutes). </li>
        <li>Remove cheesecake from overn and set on rack to cool.
            Once cool, refrigerate it, covered.</li>
        <li>Serve cheesecake in wedges.</li>
    </ol>
